# esc190-chess-player
A chess-playing class that I wrote in March 2019 for an assignment. Generates a tree of possible board states, and then traverses the tree to find the best current move. Also includes an interface to play chess with a human player.

Note that the version of chess used here is modified; no castling is allowed, and pawns can never move two moves. This was implemented as part of the assignment spec so that we couldn't use an actual chess engine.
